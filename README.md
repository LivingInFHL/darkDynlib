# darkDynlib
Delphi platform-agnostic wrapper classes around OS dynamic library loading functions.

darkDynlib is already functional, but as-yet does not perform error checking and is not thoroughly tested.
The library has been extracted from the darkGlass project https://github.com/chapmanworld/DarkGlass as a sub-module which can be used independently. 

Pending release status.
